# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (unreleased)

- Few labels: `label --few-shot K` puts K gold examples per class in the teacher's prompt (`{examples}`);
  `train --gold-only` adds a baseline student trained on those labels alone; `train --seeds N` reports the mean
  and standard deviation over training seeds.
- The teacher packs several short texts into one forward pass (`--teacher-tokens`).
- New commands: `init` (a starter task file from a dataset), `compare` (one table across runs) and `push`
  (upload to the Hugging Face Hub with a model card).
- The package exports the whole pipeline for use from Python.
- Results tables list the baseline and upper-bound rows after the deployable rows.

## 0.2.0

- First release on PyPI.
- Teacher scoring in one forward pass per text with a prefix tree of the labels; labels are scored over their
  surface forms (lowercase, Capitalised, UPPERCASE, with and without a leading space), configurable per task.
- Label ids become natural-language names; optional label descriptions.
- `train --gold-per-class K` and `--upper-bound`; `label --cache-dir` to share teacher scores between runs.
- 4-bit teachers (`--load-4bit`).

## 0.1.0

- `label`, `train`, `export`, `eval`, `predict` and `run`; ONNX export with int8 quantisation.
